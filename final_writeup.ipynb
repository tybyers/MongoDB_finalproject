      "\n",
      "This report details my acquisition, cleanup, and exploration of the [OpenStreetMap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=11/39.5663/-106.1417) map data for the majority of Summit County, Colorado, to include Vail in Eagle County. I focused on recreational items listed within the map, rather than focusing as heavily on addresses, business, and other amenities. In large part this was due to the fact that I found that the map was fairly complete with respect to listing mountain peaks, ski pistes, and ski chair lifts.  Some slight cleanup was required.  However, the map was very incomplete with respect to listing businesses and other amenities. \n",
      "\n",
      "This writeup details some problems I encountered with the data, an overview of the data, and some other ideas about the data set.  For a more thorough treatment of the exploratory data analysis and cleaning I did for this project, you can look at [my EDA iPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tybyers/MongoDB_finalproject/blob/master/exploring_data.ipynb)."

      "###Problems With the Data\n",
      "\n",
      "My initial problem with the data was simply downloading a data set that was of a reasonable size.  My first few attempts included much larger areas, and I canceled the downloads after 150-200 MB had downloaded.  I finally settled on a reasonable size data set (89 MB download) that included the four Summit County, CO ski areas and Vail across the county line.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As I explored the data, I found a few problems that needed to be cleaned up:\n",
      "\n",
      " * Addresses to clean up.\n",
      " * A few mountain peaks without an elevation.  \n",
      " * Decisions on how to format chair lifts in the database.\n",
      " * Bad chair lift tag, one gondola listed as a chair lift.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "####Address clean-up\n",
      "Only *one* address:street tag I could find needed cleaning up -- 'summit place  shopping centre' needed to be changed to 'Summit Place'.  It turns out that this was a place called \"The Steaming Bean\" cafe -- I verified their address online.  There were a few other odd addresses, but they were all \"Highway 9\".  A Highway 9 address is a valid address for places along the Highway just outside of Breckenridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I corrected The Steaming Bean's address after the data had been loaded into MongoDB:\n",

      "####Mountain Peaks\n",
      "A large majority of the mountain peaks in this map area show their elevation in meters with an xml tag: `<tag k=\"ele\" v=\"3019\"/>`. However, there were four peaks that did not show their elevations. Upon closer inspection, all of the affected peaks turned out to be duplicate nodes -- with the other half of each duplicate having complete elevation information.  So, I deleted these peaks from the database:\n",

      "Chair lifts are considered as aerialways: (`<tag k=\"aerialway\" v=\"chair_lift\"/>`). However, there are other types of aerialways in the data. There are also some sub-tags within aerialways, such as `aerialway:occupancy`. One aerialway had a typo `chari_lift` that needed to be fixed (fixed in the Python code writing to database).\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to make *all* aerialway tags as a subdocument, so the chair_lift tag became `'aerialway':{'type':'chair_lift'}. `\n",

The ski mountains in particular were well-documented, as were the mountain peaks, golf courses, bike trails, and the parking lots to use while playing at these amazing locations. However, other amenities were very poorly documented.  Most of the roads were from the [TIGER data](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER), and many of the building outlines sourced Bing.  A minority of businesses could be found on the maps -- as I went down the streets of Breckenridge, it looked like approximately 1 in 5 of the restaurants I know about were actually on the map.  In fact, only 30 restaurants in the whole map area were listed!  These being large resort areas, this is a very small number.  It looks like people with recreation interests did most of the work on the map, leaving much to be desired with respect to other amenities.  Compare and contrast the level of detail noted between the ski runs' data, the peaks' data, and the ameneties' data in the queries below.\n",

      "###Conclusion\n",
      "After fairly thoroughly exploring the data for the Summit County (plus Vail) ski resort areas and surrounding towns, it is apparent that recreation-lovers have done a good job mapping the key recreation facilities.  However, much of the rest of the map remains fairly incomplete -- very few businesses, restaurants, and other useful amenities are mapped.  Some finer detail could be added to a few of the ski lifts and runs (duration, occupancy, type of grooming), but for the average user, the data are fairly complete to help them get to their adventure destination. But then what does a person do for *apr\u00e9s ski*?  Some of this mapping may be fairly easy to do for someone willing to walk around these small towns with a GPS unit, to add a number of nodes.  The buildings are well-mapped, so someone just needs to add the nodes for these other amenities.  Then, the map would be useful for the day-time fun, as well as for the fun once the sun goes down."
