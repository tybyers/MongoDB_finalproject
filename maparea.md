## Map Area

I chose an area in the mountains of Colorado that I frequent.  It is area that includes the four ski areas of Summit County (Breckenridge, Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, and Copper Mtn), and extends over the county line into Eagle County to Vail Mountain in the west.  I love this area of my state, and I go skiing all the time in the winter and ride on the bike trails in the summer.  Rather than focus my project on a city area, I wanted to do some "nontraditional" features that I thought other students completing projects might not focus on.  So, rather than spending a lot of time looking at amenities, schools, streets, and such, I focused more on "recreational" items, including ski areas (lifts and pistes), peaks, and bike trails.
