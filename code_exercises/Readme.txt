This directory contains code for the Lesson 6 exercises.  I have cut and paste directly from the Udacity code windows into here.

Note, the only changes I did between the Udacity code and the code here is change the name of the osm files and the lines of code that opened the respective osm files -- most of the problems used a slightly different "example.osm" file; however, they were all named "example.osm" on their separate code pages.
